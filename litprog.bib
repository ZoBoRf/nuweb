%%%                        CONVENTIONS
%%%
%%%                        Books are tagged by the first author's last
%%%                        name, a colon, up to 3 upper-case letters
%%%                        taken from the first three upper-case words
%%%                        in the title (ignoring words like A, And,
%%%                        The), followed by the last two digits of
%%%                        the publication year.  If there is a volume
%%%                        entry, it is appended to the tag, prefixed
%%%                        by a hyphen.
%%%
%%%                        For Dutch authors, a van part is included
%%%                        in the author tag.  For names with accented
%%%                        letters, accents are dropped in the author
%%%                        tag.
%%%
%%%                        This scheme is systematic enough that it
%%%                        can be programmed: most of the
%%%                        Addison-Wesley book entries were created
%%%                        with an awk program from a dump of the AW
%%%                        database supplied by Mona Zeftel.  Older
%%%                        entries in this bibliography were modified
%%%                        on 28-Nov-1990 to conform to this tagging
%%%                        scheme.
%%%
%%%                        The choice of a limit of 3 letters was
%%%                        determined from experiments on the
%%%                        Addison-Wesley collection.  Long tags are
%%%                        undesirable because they are a nuisance to
%%%                        type, and also interfere with the tagged
%%%                        bibliography output produced using the
%%%                        LaTeX showtags style option.
%%%
%%%                        Journal article tags look like
%%%                        author:abbrev-volume-number-page, where the
%%%                        author part is the last name of the first
%%%                        author: for example, VanWyk:CACM-33-3-361.
%%%
%%%                        Technical report tags look like
%%%                        author:abbrev-number: for example,
%%%                        Billawala:STAN-CS-89-1256.
%%%
%%%                        The Como InProceedings entries look like
%%%                        author:TEX85-page: for example,
%%%                        Agostini:TEX85-117.  Other InProceedings
%%%                        entries should follow a similar style.
%%%
%%%                        Entries are stored ordered by the BibTeX
%%%                        tag name, independent of the entry type
%%%                        (the GNU Emacs function sort-bibtex-entries
%%%                        can be used to ensure correct ordering).
%%%                        However, entries that are cross-referenced
%%%                        by others are stored at the end of the
%%%                        file, since that order is required by
%%%                        BibTeX.
%%%
%%%                        With few exceptions, value fields for
%%%                        acknowledgement, address, journal, and
%%%                        publisher keywords should use macros
%%%                        defined in the string preamble below.  This
%%%                        helps to ensure consistency, and reduces
%%%                        the entry sizes.  Address entries must
%%%                        always include the country.
%%%
%%%                        The checksum field above contains a CRC-16
%%%                        checksum as the first value, followed by the
%%%                        equivalent of the standard UNIX wc (word
%%%                        count) utility output of lines, words, and
%%%                        characters.  This is produced by Robert
%%%                        Solovay's checksum utility."

                paper is an adaptation of Donald Knuth's concept
                of literate programming, applied to Smalltalk
                programs. The environment provides a multi-media
                document production system including media for
                Smalltalk class and method definitions.\par There
                are two outputs from the system. The first output
                is a document which contains general descriptions
                and discussions intermixed with precise
                definitions of program fragments, test inputs and
                test results. The second output consists of
                compiled Smalltalk programs installed and ready
                for execution.\par The main idea was to produce
                program documentation that was just as
                interesting and fascinating to read as ordinary
                literature. Our experience showed an added
                benefit, namely that the literate programming
                environment was an active aid in the problem
                solving process. The simultaneous programming and
                documentation lead to significantly improved
                quality of both programs and documentation.",

  abstract =    "{\bf Cweb} is a system of structured
                documentation based of Knuth's {\tt WEB}. The
                philosophy behind both {\bf cweb} and {\tt WEB}
                is that an experienced programmer, who wants to
                provide the best possible documentation of his or
                her software products, needs two things
                simultaneously: a language for formatting and a
                language for programming. When both are
                appropriately combined we obtain a system much
                more useful than either language separately.
                {\bf Cweb} combines {\bf C} source with ({\bf
                di}){\bf troff} (or {\bf nroff}) documentation
                (whereas {\tt WEB} operates with Pascal and
                \TeX). The full facilities of {\bf C} and {\bf
                troff} are available to the user.\par {\bf Cweb}
                operates effectively with existing Unix text and
                program development tools, such as {\bf make},
                {\bf tbl}, {\bf eqn}. If speed is important, {\bf
                cweb} has a built-in formatter which is much
                faster (and less resource consuming) the {\bf
                troff} for drafting or using with a lineprinter.",

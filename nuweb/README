Here's an intermediate version of nuweb.  We've bundled up the
web source (nuweb.w), the generated .c files, file, and the assorted
auxiliary files for latex'ing with a Makefile.

Note that it's still not completely portable to every system without
change.  In particular, it expect file-names to use '/' to delimit
directories unless you are on MSDOS (where it's '\') or VMS (where
we use ':' and ']') and it still thinks tab stops are set every eight
spaces.  It also uses tempnam() which may not be available everywhere.
tmpnam() might be made to work in some systems.  If all else fails,
just use some adequately unlikely filename.

To print the documentation, you must first run latex on the file
nuwebdoc.tex.  To fix up all the citations, you'll need several runs.

	latex nuwebdoc
	bibtex nuwebdoc
	latex nuwebdoc
	latex nuwebdoc

Note that the distributed nuwebdoc.tex is basically Chapter 1 of the
complete nuweb.tex generated by running nuweb against itself.

To actually build the nuweb executable, type "make nuweb" which should build
an executable file called "nuweb".  After that, you should be able to
use the makefile to control everything very nicely.

To view the nuweb sources using an HTML viewer, copy nuweb.w to
nuweb.hw, and then add the html document-style option to nuweb.hw.
After producing the LaTeX source file nuweb.tex, convert it to HTML
using LaTeX2HTML.

<h2>History</h2>

The <tt>nuweb</tt> system for Literate Programming was initially
developed several years ago by Preston Briggs, and was later
extended as part of Marc Mengel's Master's Thesis to help work with both
specifications in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_notation">Z</a>
(in effect, LaTeX source in a LaTeX/nuweb document) and the code that
implements the specification in a common document.

<p>
At that time Preston wasn't interested in making new <tt>nuweb</tt>
releases, so Marc took over maintenance of it, with his permission.

<p>
At present, Simon Wright and Keith Harwood are the active maintainers.
